Multiplayer chess game in python on processing 
I planed on implementing a multiplayer Chess Game using processing 3.0 and Python3.

Chess is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen, and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game. During the game, the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Please find below the list of features we plan to integrate into the game:

-Creating board and display method

-Assign the directions for each piece (possible movements a piece can make)

-Checking for attack and possible kill

-Alternate player turns and indicate the next turn on the side panel

-Check_win method for checkmate

-Display Game over the message

-Handle keyboard input for the game to start or restart

-Coloring the positions a piece can possibly move to

-Creating customized strips and animations for pieces

-Getting each piece and instantiating them as objects

-Initializing the objects at their respective positions

-Handling mouse input and moving pieces

-Replacing the pieces and displaying them at the side if a kill is made

-Adding sound if the piece is moved, killed, or replaced

-Checking for a check made to king and halting all other pieces movement accordingly

-Having different themes and colors for the board

-Displaying turn of the player
